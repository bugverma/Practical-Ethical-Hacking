We do Brute Force Attacks because:
1. To Check Password Strength
2. Check whether we are able to Log In or Not
3. Check whether Blue Team gets Notified by any Alerts or not.

We will use 2 tools:

## Hydra

> hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt ssh://192.168.137.134:22 -t 4 -V

where,

-l -> Username
-L -> Username File
-p -> Password
-P -> Password File
-t -> Threads
-V -> Verbosity

## Metasploit
