**Credential Stuffing** - The Proccess of using a List of known Usernames and Passwords that you would get from OSINT ie. dehashed etc, aiming at allowing us to Log In.

**Password Spraying** - The Process of using a List of Known Username with a Single Unknown but Common Password aiming at allowing us to Log In.

## Burpsuite

We:

1. Go to the Sign In Page.
2. Make sure that Proxy Intercept is On.
3. We enter Random Username & Password and Hit Enter.
4. We go to Burpsuite.
5. Right Click and then Send to Intruder.
6. Where we Clear $, and add it around Username & Password.
7. We choose Attack Type to Sniper - When we want to guess either the Password or Username and Pitchfork when we want to guess both.
8. In case of Credential Stuffing we go to Payloads and Load or Enter Usernames and Passwords, Attack Type - ForkBomb. In case of Passsword Spraying, we enter a Fixed Password and Enter Usernames as List, Attack Type - Sniper.
19. Then we Start the Attack and Look Out for:
	1. Different Status Code
	2. Different Content Page Length
	3. We can also Add a Line/ Messaga that comes when Sign In Fails and Grep it by adding the Message in Options.

Have a Look at the Video for Demo.

These 2 are the most common ways of guessing password and getting in.

While doing it in External Environment, it is okay, but in case of Internal Assessment ie. AD, before doing so, ask the Client about Lock Out Possibilty cause Accounts can get Suspended if the Password Fails a lot of time which can lead to DOS.
