The 5 Stages of Any type of Pentesting are:
1. Reconnaissance:
	- Also known as Information Gathering.
	- There are 2 types:
		- Active: The Attacker Actively interacts with the Target ie. by using Tools.
		- Passive: The Attacker doesn't Interact with the Target and mostly uses Open Source Information and sometimes a few tools.
1. Scanning & Enumeration:
	- Similar to Reconnaissance, but you look for Open Ports & Technologies that are being used ie. Scanning and then you look for Outdates Software or Technologies being used an find any Useful Exploit against them ie. Enumeration.
2. Exploitation:
	- We use that Exploit to Attack the Target and Hopeful Gain Acces to the Machine.
3. Maintaining Access
	- We would now want to try some ways of Maintaining that Access, in a way that even if our Target Shuts Down the System and then Restarts it, we still have Access, we can do this by using a Malware, and making Users.
4. Covering Tracks
	- In Black Hat Hacker's World, it refers to Deleting Logs and making sure that you don't leave any information behind that would let the Target find out about the Attacker, in White Hat Hacker's World, it refers to Deleting Created Users, Removing Malware ie. Cleaning the System and making sure it is in the same situation, it was before the Pentest.
