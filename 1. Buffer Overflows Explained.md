## Anatomy of Memory

![[Pasted image 20221207225703.png]]

**KERNEL**
- Top of Memory
- In order to understand, think of it as Command Line and a Bunch of 1's.

**TEXT**
- Bottom of Memory
- In order to understand, think of it as Read Only Code and a Bunch of 0's.

## STACK

Inside of Stack, we have various Registers.

**ESP**
- Extended Stack Pointer
- Top

**EBP**
- Extended Base Pointer
- Bottom

### Buffer Space

- Fills up with Characters.
- It goes Downwards.
- If the Buffer Space is Sanatised then when we Send a Bunch of Characters like a Bunch of A's, Buffer Space should be able to Contain the Characters you Sent ie. as soon as it reaches the EBP, it should stop.

## Buffer Overflow Attack

In Buffer Overflow Attack, the Attacker Overflows the Buffer Space being used and Reach Over EBP and Write into Something Called EIP.

**EIP**
- Extended Instruction Pointer
- It stores Pointer Address or Return Address.
- We can use this to Pointer Address to Directions we Instruct. These Directions are Malicious Code that gives us a Reverse Shell and give us the Access to Root.

## Steps to Conduct a Buffer Overlow

1. Spiking - A process used to Find Vulnerable Part of a Program.
2. Fuzzing - Send a Bunch of Characters at Program and see if we can Break it.
3. Finding the Offset - If we are able to Break it, we need to Find Out at what Point ie. Offset does the Program breaks
4. Overwriting the EIP - Use Offset to Overwrite to EIP.
5. Finding Bad Character
6. Finding Right Module
7. Generating Shell Code - Use of 5 and 6, generates a Shell Code that gives us a Reverse Shell.
8. Root - Point EIP to that Payload and Gain Root.
