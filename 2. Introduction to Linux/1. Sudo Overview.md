Kali is a Debian based Linux Machine.

In earlier versions of Kali ie. < 2020.1, we were allowed to Log In as Root Users, but in newer Versions, we cannot do so. 

If we want to Run a Command as a Root User, then we need to Specify - **sudo** ie. *Super User Do* before every Command.

If we want to run commands as Root User all the time then we can Switch to Root user by:

> sudo su -

where su -> Switch User

In order to for a User to Execute Commands as Root or Administrator, the User needs to be a Part of the Sudoers File.
