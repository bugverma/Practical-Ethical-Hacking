While Uploading a Malicious File ie. Malware to the Target, we try to Upload to a Folder where majority of the Files have Executable Privileges. Hence, we try to upload it to:

Majority of the Malicious FIles should have 777 Permissions but an Exception is SSH PEM Files where the Permissions are usually - 644(Read, Write & Read & Read) or 400 (Read).
