**Show All IP Addresses of Neighbouring Devices**

*NEW METHOD*

> ip n

*OLD METHOD*

> arp -a

## ARP
- Address Resolution Protocol.
- A Broadcast Message is Sent in the Whole Network asking, who is <IP_ADDRESS> and then the Device Replies with its MAC Address, then, a Table is Formed stating that This IP Address belongs to this MAC Address/ Device.

**PING**

> ping <IP_ADDRESS>

It tells us whether the IP Address is Reachable and Alive or not.
It uses ICMP Packets, hence if the Devices allow ICMP Traffic only then we can know for sure whether the Device is Reachable & Alive or not.

If we do not get a Response from Device using *ping*, then it deosn't mean that the device is for sure not Reachable, we would use, *Ping Sweeping*, in that case.

**NETSTAT**

> netstat

It tells us about the Open Ports & Services on a Device.

## Routing (LEARN MORE)

Routing is very Important while Pentesting as it allows us to know whether a Network is Completely Segmented or not, it also allows us to Connect to a Network which we didn't usually have Access to by simple just Adding it to the Routing Table.

*OLD WAY*

> route

*NEW WAY*

> ip r
