Command to Check IP Address of a Machine:
* Linux
	> ifconfig
* Windows
	> ipconfig

inet -> IPv4 Address - It uses Decimal Notation.
inet6 -> IPv6 Address - It uses Hexadecimal Notation.

We communicate using IP Addresses over Layer 3 of OSI Model.

## IPv4 Addresses

**192.168.137.133**
* 4 Octects/ 4 Bytes
* 1 Octet consists of 8 Bits
* Hence, IPv4 Address comprises of 32 Bits.

```
		128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1
--------------------------------------
255 |   1    1   1   1   1   1   1   1
0   |   0    0   0   0   0   0   0   0
7   |   0    0   0   0   0   1   1   1
```

ie. IPv4 -> 7.7.7.7 = 00000111.00000111.00000111.00000111

There are a Total of 2^32 IPv4 Addresses ie. 4,294,967,296.

When Internet was Emerging, no one ever could ever Predict that it would get so Huge. Hence, at that time, Researchers thought that 4 Billion IP Addresses would be more than needed to cope up with the demands, but they turned out to be extremely wrong.

Those 4 Billion IP Addresses were bought in Groups by Rich Organisations and then sold to ISP (Internet Service Providers) who now Rent/Sell us these IP Addresses.

Hence, we needed more IP Addresses as these Addresses, finished very quickly. Then emerged IPv6 Addresses.

## IPv6 Addresses

**fe80::20c:29ff:fe2d:fcc4**
* It consists of a Total of 128 Bits.
* There are a Total of 2^128 IPv6 Addresses ie. 3.402823669209385e38, which is way more than we will ever use in our lifetime.

But even after the Introduction of IPv6, we still widely use IPv4 Addresses because IPv6 Addresses are very Long, Difficult to Write and Not very Pretty.

We are able to use IPv4 Addresses with the help of NAT.

## NAT (Network Address Translation)

NAT is a Protocol that utilises 1 Public IP Address and uses it to form Various IPv4 Addresses for every Device in a Network.

ISPs rent everyperson a Public IPv4 Address. This IP Address is then their Networks Public IP Address. NAT then assigns every Device in a Network with a Private IP Address.

Hence, most of the Devices have their IP Addresses Starting with 192.168 (Household or Small Businesses) or 10. (Moderate Size Business).
