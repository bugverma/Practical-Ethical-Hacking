We, as an Attacker, need to figure out Points of Attack and Target the Low Hanging Juicy Fruits.

After NMAP Scan, focus more on Ports like:

- Port 80, Port 443 - HTTP, HTTPS
- Port 139, Port 445 - SMB

And Comparatively Less on Ports like:

- Port 22 - SSH

The Reason is because In Case of the Prior, both Websites and SMB have a bad Security History ie. both of them have a lot of Common Exploits ie. SMB Vulnerability Exploit called Eternal Blue ie. MS17-010 which led to a Ransomware (Malware) called WannaCry in 2017.
Whereas in case of Protocols like SSH, they do not have such a bad history, we can Enumerate them and probably the only Exploitation or Attacks you can carry out on them are Brute Force and no Remote Code Execution (RCE) ie. No Shell, which doesn't really allow us to do anything, and the chances of Attacker getting the Correct Password is not a lot.

## HTTP & HTTPS

#### What To Do?

1. Open the Website on both HTTP and HTTPS.
2. View Source Code and look for Comments stating any Sensitive Information ie. Keys, Usernames & Passwords.
3. Click on Available Various Links and Explore.
4. Use Tools like Dirbuster/ Dirb/ Gobuster to find out more Directories/ Web Pages that can be visited by us and looked for Information Disclosure.
5. Use Tools like Burpsuite & look for Information Disclosure.
6. Use Tools like Nikto to look for Vulnerabilties & Enumeration & Exploits at the same time.

## TOOLS

### nikto

> nikto -h <DOMAIN_NAME>

where,
- h : Hostname

Eg.

> nikto -h http://192.168.137.134/

#### FINDINGS

1. Default Web Page
	1. Although it is Not Exploitable, but it is Bad Hygiene ie. it allows Attackers to know about Underlying Technologies and Architecture.
2. Information Disclosure

Eg.

4. File Extension:
	- This can be .txt, .pdf, .docx, .tar, .rar, .zip
	- We Chose .php because the Framework is Using Apache, if it was using Microsoft, we would have used something like .asp or .aspx
