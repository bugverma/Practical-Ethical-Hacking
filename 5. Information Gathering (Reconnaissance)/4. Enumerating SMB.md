## SMB

- It stands for Server Message Block.
- It is a Networking Protocol that is used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on aÂ network.
- It is used in Work/ Internal Environment.
- Eg.
	- A Drive/ File Share that is used by You and the Other Employees of the Organisation to Upload, Access and Download Files from.
	- Whenever a Document is Scanned by a Printer on a Network, the Scanned Document appears in a Scanned Folder on your Machine.
- SMB or Samba is a lot of times Vulnerable and has a lot of Exploits, most Famous being WannaCry ie. Eternal Blue or MS17-010.

### Connect to Machine & Access File Shares

#### SMBCLIENT

- It is a Tool used to Try & Connect to File Shares using Anonymous Login which allows us to Access File Shares and the Files in them. These Files can be Sensitive.

> smbclient -L ////<IP_ADDRESS>//
> or
> smbclient -L //<IP_ADDRESS>

where -L is used to List All the Available File Shares

Eg.
![[Pasted image 20221104040328.png]]

To Connect to a File Share:

> smbclient ///<IP_ADDRESS>//<FILE_SHARE_NAME$>

Eg.
![[Pasted image 20221104040505.png]]

Anonymous Login Failed.
Now we will try to Connect to the Other File Share.
