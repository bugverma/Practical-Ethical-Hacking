There are 2 types of Reconnaissance:
1. Passive Reconnaissance
2. Active Reconnaissance

## Passive Reconnaissance

1. Physical/ Social
	- Physical Reconnaissance - Physically Going at the Site & Looking for Information ie. How tall is the Building, Are there Security Guards, Is any Floor not Closed, where do Employees Smoke etc. All this Information allows an Attacker to Enter a Site Safely.
	- Soical Reconnaissance - It refers to Social Engineering ie. Phishing & Vishing to gain Unauthorised Access to Information.\
	- Eg. Location Information - Getting Information ie. Satellite Images using Drones & getting information like Building Layout, & figuring out Open Doors (At All Time).
	- Eg. Job Information = Getting Information ie. Employees Data ie. their Badges, their Desktop and using it to Create ones Fake Cart which can be used to Gain Access to the Office.
2. Web/ Host
	- Target Validation - Making sure that we are Carrying out the Pentest on the Correct Target.
	- Web Reconnaissance - Discovering Sub Domains by using tools like Google Fu, nmap, sublister etc.
	- Fingerprinting (Active (Directty Interacting with Webiste) & Passive Both ()):  In refers to finding all the Important Ports and Services that are Running on a Machine. EG. 
	- Databreach: In today's day, it is very diffuclt to attack a Machine using Outdated Software, hence we have to look at all the Open Source Information ie. Last times Breached Passwords.
