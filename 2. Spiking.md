*NOTE: Disable your Windows Defender Real Time Protection*

**Run `Immunity Debugger` and `Vulnserver` as `administartor`**

**STEP 1**: Connecting to the Vulnserver

Vulnserver runs on Port 9999 as Default.

```
└─# nc -nv 192.168.137.134 9999                         
```

We can see that, we have a bunch of commands that we can use to interact with the `vulnserver`.
We will now try and use the technique of `spiking` to see, out of all these commands, which command is vulnerable to buffer overflow attack. 

**We will throw a bunch of characters to every command one at a time and see in which we are able to overflow the buffer space.**

**If we are able to do so, then the program should crash and we will know if that particular command is vulnerable to buffer overflow or not. If it doesn't crash, then it means it's most probably not vulnerable.**

## Trying it on a NON Vulnerable Command - STATS

**TOOL:** Generic Send TCP

> ./generic_send_tcp <IP_ADDRESS> <PORT_NUMBER> <SPIKE_SCRIPT>.spk 0 0

*stats.spk*

```
s_readline();
s_string("STATS");
s_string_variable("0");
```

```
└─# generic_send_tcp 192.168.137.134 9999 stats.spk 0 0
```

Nothing Happened, Immunity Debugger is still Running, that means that the Program did NOT crash.

## Trying it on a Vulnerable Command - TRUN

*trun.spk*

```
s_readline();
s_string("TRUN ");
s_string_variable("0");
```

```
└─# generic_send_tcp 192.168.137.134 9999 trun.spk 0 0
```

And it Paused ie. it Crashed, and also we can see an overflow of A's on all the Registers. This means that `TRUN ` command is vulnerable.
