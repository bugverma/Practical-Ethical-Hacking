We want to Enumerate the Version of the SSH.

We can do this by:
1. NMAP Scan
2. SSH/ Connecting to the Machine

## NMAP

Over Here, we got the Version of the SSH, but sometimes we do NOT get it.

## SSH/ Connecting to the Machine

Sometimes when we Try to Connect to a Machine via SSH, the Banner discloses certain information ie. Version Number, Who Created it etc.

> ssh <IP_ADDRESS>

Over here, the problem is that that Kioptrix is Very Old Machine and new Kali and Kioptrix need to decide a Cipher and use that for Encryption.

This Problem generally can be solved like this, but I am not able to do so, but hopefully you can.

As you can see, No Banner came up & hence, if it werent for NMAP, we would not have been able to Enumerate the Version of SSH.
