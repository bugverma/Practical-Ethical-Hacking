## NMAP

- It stands for Network Mapper.
- It is a tool that allows us to Scan for Open Ports & Services on a Machine.
- It relies upon 3 Way Handshake ie. SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK.

### Stealth Scan / TCP SYN Scan ( -sS )
- Earlier, we had to use the flag (-sS), but now it is Default.
- It says that this is Stealth, but it actually is NOT. Earlier, it used to be Stealthy, but now it is very Detectable - although nowdays as well, machines are not programmed to keep a log and monitor this, so you can still use it.
- It relies upon - SYN, SYN-ACK, RST (Reset Flag).

***SYNTAX***

> nmap <IP_ADDRESS>

> nmap --help          # If you need Help

### Flags

Now you can use various Flags ie.

- -T : 
	- Determines the Speed of the Scan. 
	- The Speed of the Scan ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 being the Slowest and 5 being the Fastest.
	- Important Ports can be Missed if you go for Speed 5, hence go for 4.

> nmap -T 4 <IP_ADDRESS>

- -p : 
	- Determines the Port Number/(s) or the Range of the Ports you want to Scan.
	- Default Scan is set for Top 1000 Ports ie. Top Common Ports.
	- In total, there are 65,535 Ports

> nmap -p <IP_ADDRESS>          # Top 1000 Ports
> nmap -p 80,443 <IP_ADDRESS>          # Port Number 80 & 443
> nmap -p- <IP_ADDRESS>          # All Ports ie. 65,535 Ports

#### Host Discovery

- -sN :
	- Ping Scan ie. Ping Sweep ie. Discover All Hosts in a Network.
- -Pn :
	- Treat All Hosts as Online.
	- Sometimes, a Port may appear Off, but if you are sure that it is Open, then you can force nmap to treat all the Ports as Open.

#### UDP Scan

- -sU :
	- UDP Scan
	- Do NOT Scan All Ports ie. 65,535 Ports, as it will take Forever, but Scan for Top 1000 Ports only.

### Types of Scans/ Enumeration

- -sV :
	- Service/ Version
- -sC :
	- NMAP Scripts
- -O : 
	- OS Detection

OR

- -A :
	- Everything ie. Service, Scripts, OS Detection & Traceroute.

*TIP*

1. Scan for All Open Ports without -A .
2. Then use -A for all the Discovered Open Ports.

## HOSTS Discovery

### From Attackers Machine ie. KALI

1. Use *netdiscover*

> netdiscover -r <NETWORK_/SUBNET_MASK>

Eg.

> netdiscover -r 192.168.137.0/24

2. Use *arp-scan*

> arp-scan -l

### From Targets Machine ie. Kioptrix

1. Ping

> ping 8.8.8.8
